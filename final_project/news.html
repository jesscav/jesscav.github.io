<p>A six-person delegation from Hunan Normal University (HNU) in China visited with University President Mark C. Reed, Ed.D., Provost Jeanne F. Brady, Ph.D., and members of the Saint Joseph’s University community on April 22.</p>
<p>The visit follows an agreement St. Joe’s signed with HNU last year for students to study abroad at St. Joe’s, the eighth agreement of its kind with universities in China. The delegation was made up of six administrators, including Li Dazhi, Ph.D., Vice President of Hunan Normal.</p>
<p>“It allows their [undergraduate] students to come here and study abroad,” said Cary Anderson, Ph.D., vice president of Student Life and associate provost. “The other part of the agreement is that the students from their university, if they meet certain criteria, can come to study in our graduate school.”</p>
<p>There is currently one student from Hunan Normal studying at St. Joe’s and many other students who are interested in attending next year.</p>
<p>Zilu “Bunny” Liu, a junior at Hunan Normal, has been at St. Joe’s since August, and will return to China in May.</p>
<p>“Not everyone can come for four years, so it’s nice to have somebody come in for a semester or a year to be able to study here,” Anderson said.</p>
<p>One of the reasons Liu decided to come to St. Joe’s was because she wanted to continue with her masters’ degree in America.</p>
<p>Liu added that she loves American culture and wanted the opportunity to meet lots of new people.</p>
<p>“It helps to globalize and diversify our campus,” Anderson said. “Having students from other countries come and study here is helpful. I think the nice benefit is having the students have the experience and interact with other students in classes and those types of things.”</p>
<p>Juan Julie Yu, Ph.D., director of the Chinese program and recruitment at Saint Joseph’s, who received her undergraduate degree at Hunan Normal, went with Anderson to Hunan last January and hosted an information session for students.</p>
<p>Yu noted how warmly those at Hunan Normal received her and Anderson. Representatives introduced Anderson to the culture of Hunan.</p>
<p>“My point is to do a culture exchange, and it is our turn to introduce [to] them more about American higher education as well as American culture,” Anderson said. “We are just trying to increase our partnership and it is always good to meet with people. So they’ll meet with the president and the provost and the deans. Then we will host them for dinner. It is a good way to continue to build our relationship.”</p>
<p>In addition to Reed and Brady, the delegation met with both Chinese and American students from St. Joe’s to discuss the differences in American and Chinese education systems and how to fully incorporate Chinese students into the culture at St. Joe’s. Dazhi said that they wanted to sign an agreement with St. Joe’s because of the highly ranked academic fields.</p>
<p>Hunan Normal has 24 partnerships with other universities in the United States, but St. Joe’s is the only one in Philadelphia, Dazhi said.</p>
<p>Anderson explained that while right now the focus is on agreements with schools in China, St. Joe’s also has exchange programs in Chile and throughout Europe.</p>
<p>“We have had agreements with various institutions for more than 10 years,” Anderson said. “We are reviewing some of the ones we’ve had for a while that maybe we haven’t had a lot of activity on and maybe we won’t renew those and maybe we will start some other ones. It was a program that was started before I arrived and we are continuing to maintain that. There is real interest in Chinese students to come to the states so I think that it is a good market to do that on.”</p>
