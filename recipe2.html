<h1> Italian Bread Bowl</h1>

<p>These cute little bread bowls are a great way to serve soup in the wintertime.
They freeze for up to 1 month, if desired.</p>

<div id="ingredients">
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast</li>
  <li>7 cups all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>2 1/2 cups warm water
    <ul>
      <li>110 degrees F/45 degrees C</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>1 tablespoon cornmeal</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
  <li>1 egg white</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="directions">
<h2>Directions:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Add salt, oil and 4 cups flour to the yeast mixture; beat well. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well with an electric mixer at medium speed after each addition.</li>
  <li>When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 6 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.</li>
  <li>Punch dough down, and divide into 8 equal portions. Shape each portion into a 4 inch round loaf. Place loaves on lightly greased baking sheets sprinkled with cornmeal. Cover and let rise in a warm place, free from drafts, until doubled in bulk, about 35 minutes.</li>
  <li>TPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a small bowl, beat together egg white and 1 tablespoon water; lightly brush the loaves with half of this egg wash.</li>
  <li>Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Brush with remaining egg mixture, and bake 10 to 15 more minutes or until golden. Cool on wire racks.</li>
  <li>To make bowls: Cut a 1/2 inch thick slice from top of each loaf; scoop out centers, leaving 3/4-inch-thick shells. Fill bread bowls with hot soup and serve immediately.

      <li>Aluminum foil can be used to keep food moist, cook it evenly, and make clean-up easier.</li>
